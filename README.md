###### Visualizing worldwide solar PV capacity and consumption.
##### Create an interactive web application that displays worldwide solar energy generation and consumption, per country, between 1996 and 2018 (data obtained from bp.com)

###### Create a basic HTML web page and design it with CSS and Bootstrap.
